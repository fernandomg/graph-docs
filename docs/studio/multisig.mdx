title: Using a Multisig wallet
---

Subgraph Studio currently doesn't support signing with Multisig wallets. Until we do, you can follow 
our guide on how to publish your subgraph by invoking 
the [GNS contract](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/dev/contracts/discovery/GNS.sol) functions. 

### Create a subgraph
Similary to using a regular wallet, you can create a subgraph by connecting your non-multisig wallet 
in Studio. Once you are connected the wallet and signed, simply create a new subgraph.
Make sure you fill out all the details, such as subgraph name, description, image, website and 
source code url if applicable.

For initializing a starter subgraph, you can follow the commands shown in the UI, or simply run
```
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

Where `SUBGRAPH_SLUG` is the name of your subgraph that you can copy from the UI, or from the URL 
in the browser.
This command should create a folder in your file system with all the necessary files to start developing a subgraph.

### Deploy a subgraph
Once your subgraph is ready to be deployed to the graph node, simply follow the commands shown in the UI,
or run the following command:
```
graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

__Note__: Make sure that you are inside of the subgraph folder before running that command.

### Publish a subgraph or a version
You can either publish a new subgraph to the decentralized network or publish a new version of the 
previously published subgraph.

#### Publish a new subgraph
There are a couple of ways to publish a subgraph using Multisig wallets, here we'll describe 
invoking the [`publishNewSubgraph`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/dev/contracts/discovery/GNS.sol#L231) function
in the [GNS contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaDcA0dd4729c8BA3aCf3E99F3A9f471EF37b6825) using Etherscan.

Before we use that function, we need to generate input arguments for it. Access [this page](https://thegraph.com/studio/multisig) in 
Studio and provide:
- Ethereum address of your Multisig wallet
- Subgraph that you want to publish
- Version that you want to publish 

After clicking on "Get Arguments" we'll generate all the contract arguments for you! 

There should be 4 arguments:
- `graphAccount`: which is your Multisig account address 
- `subgraphDeploymentID`: which is the hex hash of the deployment ID for that subgraph
- `versionMetadata`: version metadata (label and description) gets uploaded to IPFS, and we provide
 the hex hash value for that JSON file
- `subgraphMetadata`: simlarly to version metadata, subgraph metadata (name, image, description, website and source code url)
gets uploaded to IPFS, and we provide the hex hash value for that JSON file

With those 4 arguments, you should be able to go [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaDcA0dd4729c8BA3aCf3E99F3A9f471EF37b6825#writeProxyContract)
and pass them into the `publishNewSubgraph` function. 

#### Publish a new version
If a subgraph you selected already has one version published to decentralized network (Testnet or Mainnet) 
and you are trying to publish another version to that same network, you'll need to invoke 
[`publishNewVersion`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/dev/contracts/discovery/GNS.sol#L255) function
in the [GNS contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaDcA0dd4729c8BA3aCf3E99F3A9f471EF37b6825) using Etherscan. 

Before we use that function, we need to generate input arguments for it. Access [this page](https://thegraph.com/studio/multisig) in 
Studio and provide:
- Ethereum address of your Multisig wallet
- Subgraph that you want to publish
- Version that you want to publish 

After clicking on "Get Arguments" we'll generate all the contract arguments for you! 

There should be 4 arguments:
- `graphAccount`: which is your Multisig account address 
- `subgraphNumber`: is the number of your already published subgraph. It is a part of the subgraph id
for a published subgraph queried through the graph network subgraph.
- `versionMetadata`: version metadata (label and description) gets uploaded to IPFS, and we provide
 the hex hash value for that JSON file
- `subgraphDeploymentID`: which is the hex hash of the deployment ID for that subgraph

With those 4 arguments, you should be able to go [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaDcA0dd4729c8BA3aCf3E99F3A9f471EF37b6825#writeProxyContract)
and pass them into the `publishNewVersion` function.
