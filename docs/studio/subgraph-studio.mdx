title: How to Use the Subgraph Studio
---

Welcome to your new launchpad üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ

The Subgraph Studio is your place to build and create subgraphs, add metadata, and publish them to the new decentralized Explorer (more on that [here](https://thegraph.com/docs).

What you can do in the Subgraph Studio:
- Create, publish, and deploy subgraphs using the CLI
- Test it in the playground
- Integrate it in staging using the query URL
- Create and manage your API keys for specific subgraphs

Here in the Subgraph Studio, you have full control over your subgraphs. Not only can you test your subgraphs before you publish them, but you can also restrict your API keys to specific domains and only allow certain indexers to query from their API keys.

Querying subgraphs generates query fees, used to reward [indexers](/indexing) on the Graph network. If you‚Äôre a dApp developer or subgraph developer, the Studio will empower you to build better subgraphs to power your or your community‚Äôs queries. The Studio is comprised of 5 main parts:
- Your user account controls
- A list of subgraphs that you‚Äôve created
- A section to manage, view details, and visualize the status of a specific subgraph
- A section to manage your API keys that you will need to query a subgraph
- A section to manage your billing

## How to Create Your Account
1. Sign in with your wallet - you can do this via MetaMask or WalletConnect
1. Once you sign in, you will see your unique deploy key in your account home page. This will allow you to either publish your subgraphs or manage your API keys + billing. You will have a unique deploy key that can be re-generated if you think it has been compromised.

## How to Create your Subgraphs
The best part! When you first create a subgraph, you‚Äôll be directed to fill out:
- Your Subgraph Name
- Image
- Description
- Categories
- Website

### Subgraph lifecycle flow
![Subgraph Lifecycle](/img/subgraph-lifecycle.png)

After you have created your subgraph, you will be able to deploy it using the [CLI](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli), or command line interface. Deploying a subgraph with the CLI will push the subgraph to the Studio where you‚Äôll be able to test subgraphs using the playground. This will eventually allow you to publish to the Graph Network. For more information on CLI setup, [check this out](/developer/define-subgraph-hosted#install-the-graph-cli) (pst, make sure you have your deploy key on hand). Remember, deploying is **not the same as** publishing. When you deploy a subgraph, you just push it to the Studio where you‚Äôre able to test it.  Versus, when you publish a subgraph, you are publishing it on-chain.

## Testing your Subgraph

If you‚Äôd like to test your subgraph before publishing it to the network, you can do this in the Subgraph **Playground** or look at your logs. The Subgraph logs will tell you **where** your subgraph fails in the case that it does.

## Publish your Subgraphs

You‚Äôve made it this far - congrats! Publishing your subgraph means that an IPFS hash was generated when you deployed the subgraph within the CLI and is stored in the network‚Äôs Ethereum smart contracts. In order to publish your subgraph successfully, you‚Äôll need to go through the following steps outlined in this blog (TODO - add Nader's blog link). Check out the video overview below as well:

Remember, while you‚Äôre going through your publishing flow, you‚Äôll be able to push to either mainnet or Rinkeby, the testnet we support. If you‚Äôre a first time subgraph developer, we highly suggest you start with publishing to Rinkeby, which is free to do. This will allow you to see how the subgraph will work in The Graph Explorer and will allow you to test curation elements.

You‚Äôll only be able to query data from the mainnet (even if your subgraph was published to a testnet) because only subgraphs that are querying mainnet data can be published to the network. This is due to indexers needing to submit Proof of Indexing records which is required to be submitted as of a specific block hash, so if you publish to Rinkeby, it‚Äôd be impossible to know the block hash for it on mainnet ([more details on Indexing here](/indexing)). Because publishing a subgraph is an action taken on-chain, remember that the transaction can take up to a few minutes to go through. Any address you use to publish the contract will be the only one able to publish future versions. Choose wisely!

**Now that you‚Äôve published your subgraph, let‚Äôs get into how you‚Äôll manage them on a regular basis.** Note that you cannot publish your subgraph to the network if it has failed syncing. This is usually because the subgraph has bugs - the logs will tell you where those issues exist!

## Versioning your Subgraphs

Developers might want to update their subgraph, for a variety of reasons. When this is the case, you can deploy a new version of your subgraph to the Studio using the CLI (it will only be private at this point) and if you are happy with it, you can publish this new deployment to The Graph Explorer. This will create a new version of your subgraph that curators can start signaling on and indexers will be able to index this new version.

Please note that there are costs associated with publishing a new version of a subgraph to the network. In addition to the transaction fees, developers must also fund a part of the curation tax on auto-migrating signal. You cannot publish a new version of your subgraph if curators have not signaled on it. For more information on the risks of curation, please read more [here](/curating).

## Managing your API Keys

Regardless of whether you‚Äôre a dApp developer or a subgraph developer, you‚Äôll need to manage your API keys. This is important for you to be able to query subgraphs because API keys make sure the connections between application services are valid and authorized. This includes authenticating the end user and the device using the application.

The Studio will list out existing API keys, which will give you the ability to manage or delete them.

<ol>
  <li>The <b>Overview</b> section will allow you to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Edit your key name
      </li>
      <li>
        Regenerate API keys
      </li>
      <li>
        View the current usage of the API key with stats:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Number of queries
          </li>
          <li>
            Amount of GRT spent
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Under <b>Manage Security Settings</b>, you‚Äôll be able to opt into security settings depending on the level of control you‚Äôd like to have over your API keys. In this section, you can:
    <ul>
      <li>
        View and manage the domain names authorized to use your API key
      </li>
      <li>
        You can assign subgraphs that can be queried with your API key
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

## How to Manage your Subgraphs

API keys aside, you‚Äôll have many tools at your disposal to manage your subgraphs. The **filter** function will allow you to filter subgraphs by their **status** and **category**.
- The **Status** tag allows you to pick between a variety of tags including `<created>`, `<deployed>`, `<published>`, `<archived>`, etc.
- Meanwhile, **Category** allows you to designate what category your subgraph falls into. Options include `<DeFi>`, `<NFTs>`, `<Governance>`, etc.
