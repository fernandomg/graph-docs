title: Versioning

The Graph will be adding the concept of versioning soon. When this feature is rolled out subgraphs will either be in a Draft or Published state. Draft subgraphs are under heavy development and subject to change. Care must be taken when using Draft subgraphs to specify specific subgraph ID's to ensure that an app doesn't break if a new version is deployed.

Published subgraphs are stable and cannot introduce breaking changes. It should be safe to depend on a published subgraph by name since newer versions may add new fields and entity types but can not change or modify existing field or entity type names.
